Let me think about how to break this down into manageable subtasks.\n\nFirst, they'll need to plan the project. That includes defining the scope, maybe features like user authentication, video streaming, a library, and a UI similar to Netflix. Also, choosing tech stack\u2014like React or Vue for frontend, Node.js or Python for backend, and a database.\n\nNext, setting up the development environment. Installing necessary tools like Node.js, Python, a code editor, and maybe a version control system like Git. They might need a cloud service for hosting, so setting that up too.\n\nThen, designing the backend. Creating user authentication, API endpoints for data, integrating a video streaming service (maybe AWS or Vimeo), and setting up a database with user info and content metadata.\n\nFrontend development would involve building the UI components\u2014landing page, search, profile pages\u2014using a frontend framework. Integrating the backend APIs and handling user sessions. Implementing responsive design for different devices.\n\nContent management is another part. They'll need a system to upload and categorize videos, maybe a CMS, and ensure videos are encoded for streaming with different quality options.\n\nTesting and debugging is crucial. They'll have to test all features, check performance, especially streaming speed, and fix any bugs found.\n\nDeployment and hosting: deploying backend to a server, frontend to a web host, and configuring the domain. Also setting up CDN for faster content delivery.\n\nFinally, maintenance and updates. Monitoring performance, fixing issues, adding new features based on user feedback, and ensuring security and compliance with regulations.\n\nLet me structure these thoughts into the JSON format the user wants.
