We'll assume you have some basic familiarity with the internet and computers, but no prior web development experience is necessary.  If you *do* have experience, adjust the complexity of the tasks accordingly.\n\n**Phase 1: Planning & Design (1-2 weeks)**\n\n1. **Define Website Purpose & Audience:**\n    * 1.1 Identify your target audience (e.g., potential employers, clients).\n    * 1.2 Determine the primary goal of the website (e.g., showcasing work, attracting clients, finding a job).\n    * 1.3  List 3-5 keywords describing your skills and services.\n\n2. **Content Inventory:**\n    * 2.1 Gather all relevant project materials (images, code samples, descriptions).\n    * 2.2 Write concise and compelling project descriptions highlighting key skills and accomplishments.\n    * 2.3 Draft \""About Me\"" section content, highlighting your skills and experience.\n    * 2.4  Create a list of desired features (e.g., contact form, blog, testimonials).\n\n3. **Website Structure & Design:**\n    * 3.1 Choose a website template or platform (e.g., WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or custom coding).\n    * 3.2 Create wireframes or sketches of the website's layout (Homepage, About, Projects, Contact).\n    * 3.3 Select a color palette and fonts that reflect your brand and style.  Consider using a tool like Adobe Color or Coolors.\n    * 3.4  Choose high-quality images representing your work and brand.

This will involve HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript.  Break this into smaller tasks:\n        * 5.2.1 Create the HTML structure for each page.\n        * 5.2.2 Style the pages using CSS.\n        * 5.2.3 Add interactive elements using JavaScript (optional).\n    * 5.3 Add all project details, including images, descriptions, and links to live projects (where applicable).\n    * 5.4 Add your \""About Me\"" section content.\n    * 5.5 Implement any desired features (contact form, blog, etc.).\n\n6. **Content Review & Refinement:**\n    * 6.1 Thoroughly review all website content for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.\n    * 6.2 Proofread all text for grammar and spelling errors.\n    * 6.3 Get feedback from peers or mentors on the design and content.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Testing & Launch (1 week)**\n\n7. **Testing & Debugging:**\n    * 7.1 Test the website on different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness.\n    * 7.2 Check all links and forms for functionality.\n    * 7.3 Fix any bugs or errors identified during testing.\n\n8. **Launch your website:**\n    * 8.1 Make your website live by publishing it to your domain.\n    * 8.2 Promote your new portfolio website through social media and other channels.\n\n**Phase 4: Maintenance & Updates (Ongoing)**\n\n9. **Website Maintenance:**\n    * 9.1 Regularly update website content (e.g., adding new projects, blog posts).\n    * 9.2 Monitor website performance and address any issues that arise.\n    * 9.3 Keep software and plugins updated (if applicable).\n\n\nThis detailed breakdown allows you to tackle the project in manageable chunks. Remember to celebrate each milestone!  Adjust the timeline based on your skills and available time.\n"""
